-All Aggregate functions (including count) works only on non-Null values.
They ignore NULL values in calculation.

-where is used with column name.
 Eg where price=25

-having is used with aggregate function. 
Eg having sum(price) =100

-Semicolon is not mandatory at the end of sql statement
 but it's a good practice to use it.
