Java vs Python:
Diff:
1. One of the biggest differences between Python and Java is the way that each language handles variables. 
Java is statically typed language(variable type is checked at compile time, also var are assigned data type while writing a code)
Python is dynamically typed language(variable type is checked at run time, no type needed while writing code))

Similarity:
Both are open source language (we can use openJDK without licence)


===
Dynamic typing is the act of checking for type errors as code is executed.
Python will not throw error for below as else never executes
But Java will throw complied time error.
foo = "a string"
eggs = 2
if eggs + 2 > 3: 
    print("Well Done")
else:
    print(foo + 1)

The takeaway: Python’s dynamic typing is easier for beginners.
Java’s static typing reduces the risk of undetected errors.
