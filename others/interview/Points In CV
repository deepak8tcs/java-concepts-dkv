Docker:

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level virtualization 
to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another 
and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

Standard packaging of application using docker (Industry standard now). Easily shippable & deployable.

PODA: Package once Deploy Anywhere

Dockerfile (contains path for code’s jar file, contains dependencies, commands etc)->Docker Engine->
Docker Image (can be pushed on dockerhub.com or any other docker image repo)

We can spawn the container (run time environment, lightest OS inside VM, have IP & Port, 
runs as a process inside RAM of VM(Host)/EC2) using docker image.

The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine

Docker Provides Simple Commands You Can Use To Build, Start, Or Stop Containers.

 *******************************

Kubernetes: (Job like Football coach, choreographer, keeps on monitoring each node/pod)

Orchestrator for micro-services apps.

Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.
It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

 

=>uses docker-compose.yml file

=> docker images are used as input

 

Kubernetes Cluster(k8s cluster): 3 node(VM) cluster, 2 node(VM/minions) cluster etc(1 master node, other slave node)

Pods: containers are wrapped in pods in k8s. docker container is used to be naked.

Pod->Env(container): 1 pod can have multiple containers if containers are tightly coupled. If containers are independent use one container per pod.

Kubernetes uses deployment yml files for each container.

GCS: Google Cloud service

ACS: Azure Cloud service (Microsoft)

ECS: Elastic Cloud service (Amazon)

 *****************************************

 

Katalon Studio is an automation testing solution developed by Katalon LLC. The software is built on top of the open-source
automation frameworks Selenium, Appium with a specialized IDE interface for web, API, mobile and desktop application testing.

Strength:

1.           No licensing and maintenance fees required (paid dedicated support services is available if needed).

2.           Integrating necessary frameworks and features for quick test cases creation and execution.

3.           Built on top of the Selenium framework but eliminating the need for advanced programming skills required for Selenium.

Limitations:

1.           Emerging solution with a quickly growing community.

2.           Feature set is still evolving.

3.           Lack of choices for scripting languages: only Java/Groovy is supported.

 ****************************************

Appium:

Appium is an open source automation tool for running scripts and testing native applications,
 mobile-web applications and hybrid applications on Android or iOS using a webdriver.

Groovy:

Apache Groovy is a Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. 
It is both a static and dynamic language with features similar to those of Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.

Groovy scripts can use any Java classes. They can be compiled to Java bytecode (in . class files) that
 can be invoked from normal Java classes. The Groovy compiler, groovyc, compiles both Groovy scripts 
 and Java source files, however some Java syntax (such as nested classes) is not supported yet.

 
*****************************************
Git : Version control system.

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
 It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
 
*************************
GitHub: (Repository hosting service)

Its website/company which provides services for hosting ”source code reposities”.

Uses git for version control.

 *********************************

BitBucket: similar to GitHub (Repository hosting service)

But It can use either of mercurial or git version control system.

it's a tool/website which hosts source code repository similar to git hub.

git, mercury: version control tool.

Bitbucket is more flexible than Github.

While GitHub comes with a lot of features and allows you to create your own workflows, 
BitBucket has more flexibility built in. For example, BitBucket gives you more options about the 
version control system that you use (incorporating Mercurial as well as Git).

Other terms:

Selenium vs Serenity. Which one is better & why?

Cucumber vs Jbehave. & which one is better & why?

More on Docker:

What is a Container?

A standardized unit of software

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application
runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight,
standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: 
code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers -
images become containers when they run on Docker Engine.

Containers are Lightweight: Containers share the machine’s OS system kernel and therefore do not require 
an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs
