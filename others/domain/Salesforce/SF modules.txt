Life cycle of a Lead:

2. Conversation into accounts, contacts or opportunities.

Notes: Opportunity may or may not be created upon conversion. it's created only if selected
 (select check box & give name) to create opportunity while conversion.

-Leads can come from real-life interactions, such as meeting someone at a conference; 
or they can come from online interactions, such as when someone fills out a form on your website requesting more .


- A lead is considered to be a contact when a direct two-way communication starts.
 So, when the lead expresses interest and the salesperson actively follows up, it becomes a contact. 
A contact can even be an old customer, or a friend who is in a position to influence your target company's buying decision.


-we can add a custom field(text box,drop down,check box etc) from app set up to any objects(leads, account, contacts)
