  # The first example has two steps
  Scenario: Maker starts a game
    When the Maker starts a game
    Then the Maker waits for a Breaker to join


It’s strongly recommended you only have a single When step per Scenario. 
If you feel compelled to add more, it’s usually a sign that you should split the scenario up into multiple scenarios.

Example: Multiple Givens
  Given one thing
  And another thing
  And yet another thing
  When I open my eyes
  Then I should see something
  But I shouldn't see something else

The Scenario Outline keyword can be used to run the same Scenario multiple times, with different combinations of values.
A Scenario Outline must contain an Examples section.

a simple data table and see how we might use it.

| firstName   | lastName | birthDate  |
| Annie M. G. | Schmidt  | 1911-03-20 |
| Roald       | Dahl     | 1916-09-13 |
| Astrid      | Lindgren | 1907-11-14 |

As this is a table the natural representation would be a list of a list of strings.

java type: List<List<String>>

[ 
  [ "firstName", "lastName", "birthDate" ],
  [ "Annie M.G", "Schmidt", "1911-03-20" ], 
  [ "Roald", "Dahl", "1916-09-13" ], 
  [ "Astrid", "Lindgren", "1907-11-14" ] 
]
This representation is not very useful. The fields are no longer labeled and the first row has to be discarded. So instead we can convert this table into a list of maps.

java type: List<Map<String, String>

[
  { "firstName": "Annie M.G", "lastName": "Schmidt",  "birthDate": "1911-03-20" }, 
  { "firstName": "Roald",     "lastName": "Dahl",     "birthDate": "1916-09-13" }, 
  { "firstName": "Astrid",    "lastName": "Lindgren", "birthDate": "1907-11-14" } 
]
